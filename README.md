# backgammon


Backgammon made by Unity 3D using C#.

The backgammon game is a 2-player game that involves both the movement of the checkers and also the roll of the dice.

The goal of each player is to move all of his checkers off the board.
Given the current state of the board, a roll of the dice, and the current player, it computes all the legal moves that the current player can execute.
